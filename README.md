This project focuses on biomass estimation using a deep learning model named MDL-BIO. The model incorporates multi-modal data, including optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, along with tree species information. The estimation is crucial for understanding and monitoring biomass in forest ecosystems.
